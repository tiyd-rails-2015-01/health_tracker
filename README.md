# Health Tracker

## Description

This Rails application stores information on daily weight, daily steps taken, calories consumed, and exercises performed.  

Windsong the friendly goat welcomes the user to the dashboard page, which displays net calories for the day.  Underneath the calorie information, there are four categories: food, exercise, steps, and weight.  The information from today will be displayed.  The user can select "New" to update the record, or "History" to see more than just today's entries.
