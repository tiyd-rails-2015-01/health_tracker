# Health Tracker

## Description
This health tracker application will log your daily weight, amount of steps taken, calories consumed/ burned, and exercise amount/type. We used a basic MVC architecture, utilize scaffold,
plus manually generated controllers, models, and views to create simple routes. There is a separate homepage that links all data tables together. Pair programming was used to make this
application.

To infinity and beyond.
